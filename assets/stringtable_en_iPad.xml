		<string>Glory and Peace</string>

		<key>axis battle intro 1</key>
		<string>By order of the fuehrer, you will take elite troops to \nattack Poland and General Guderian is going to fight \nwith you. Commander! The high command is looking \nforward to your success!</string>
		<key>axis battle intro 2</key>
		<string>The high command has made a plan to march westward, \nwhich splits into two lines. After bypassing the Maginot \nLine, army group A will invade Netherlands and Belgium, \nfinally Paris. Army group B aims to attack Denmark and \nNorway in North Europe for needed resources. General \nGuderian would join you to lead the campaign.</string>
		<key>axis battle intro 3</key>
		<string>It's so exciting to see our forces pass through the Arch \nof Triumph and the fuehrer is very pleased. However, \nthe intelligence tells us British and French troops are \nattempting to fight back. Of course, we won't let it \nhappen! Marshal Goering will support you with his ace \nair forces.</string>
		<key>axis battle intro 4</key>
		<string>Germany was so unstoppable in last military actions that \nthe chancellor desires to expand to the Balkans. \nConsidering Greece gets support from Britain, we invite \nBulgaria and Romania to join our glorious expansion. \nGeneral Graziani also agrees to assist you on the sea!</string>
		<key>axis battle intro 5</key>
		<string>Knowing the Italian troops are swamped in North Africa, \nthe fuehrer concerns our supply line in Mediterranean \nwould be cut off if Britain seizes North Africa. Therefore, \nwe must send relief troops immediately. Commander! \nGeneral Rommel is back from vacation. He will lead the \nbest tank army to head North Africa with you.</string>
		<key>axis battle intro 6</key>
		<string>It's time to approach the Soviet Union! The Russians \nkeep losing because of poor preparation. Now General \nGuderian starts to siege Soviet troops stationed in Kiev \nand the fuehrer hopes you could meet in Moscow as \nsoon as possible.Commander! This would be the greatest \nvictory ever if you can make it!</string>
		<key>axis battle intro 7</key>
		<string>Now America has cut off our energy sources and \ndeployed a huge navy in Pearl Harbor, which stimulates \nthe high command to set defeating Americans as our \nurgent task. General Yamamoto has prepared the \noperational plan and the Mikado places high hopes on \nus.</string>
		<key>axis battle intro 8</key>
		<string>South Pacific nations, home to rich resources which we \nare dying for, have attracted a lot of attention recently. \nTo prevent our movement, America and Britain have done \na lot of things while Australia starts to get prepared \nacross the country. Commander! It's more than boldness \nyou need to conquer them.</string>
		<key>axis battle intro 9</key>
		<string>Although we won a lot of battles in Asia, our original \ngoal has not yet come true. Currently, China joins \nBritain to fight us in Burma. Commander! If we mess \nup this time, all previous efforts are in vain.</string>
		<key>axis battle intro 10</key>
		<string>It's unbelievable that, according to the intelligence, \nAmerica is building some devastating weapon. The fuehrer \nmakes a prompt decision to bring forward the plan of \nNorth America expedition. He also discusses details with \nItaly and Japan. Commander! This is our only chance. \nDon't screw up!</string>
		
		<key>allies battle intro 1</key>
		<string>The country is falling into the most dangerous situation. \nAt this time, General Zhukov is fighting against Guderian's \narmy in Kiev while General Rokossovsky against Finland \nand Rommel's coalition forces in the north. Commander! \nYou are our last hope to protect Moscow!</string>
		<key>allies battle intro 2</key>
		<string>Commander! Japanese joint fleet is launching strikes on \nour naval base in Midway Island. If they succeed, all \nthe west coast would be under threat. We cannot afford \nthat. Moreover, we cannot let the president down. Go \nand roll them back! General Nimitz will assist you.</string>
		<key>allies battle intro 3</key>
		<string>Rommel with his armour army becomes our strongest \nenemy in North Africa. General Montgomery is seeking \nopportunity to beat them. Commander! Maybe the war \nwill end up earlier if you join in.</string>
		<key>allies battle intro 4</key>
		<string>Commander! The supreme headquarters resolve on a \nlarge-scale counterattack to kick invaders out of our \nterritory. During this operation, General Zhukov, General \nRokossovsky and you with your own army should launch \na general offensive from 3 different directions.</string>
		<key>allies battle intro 5</key>
		<string>As the battle in North Africa comes to an end, the \nsupreme headquarters plan to defeat Italy, the weakest \namong axis nations, and compel them to quit the war. \nCommander! Unfortunately Italy is not the only enemy \nwe face. Those German troops in Greece are what we \nshould really worry about!</string>
		<key>allies battle intro 6</key>
		<string>Intelligence shows Japan keeps rallying forces in Burma. \nIt seems they're ready to invade India which is the last \nBritish base in Asia. We have to get everything prepared. \nGood news is our ally Chinese forces will give us a \nhand.</string>
		<key>allies battle intro 7</key>
		<string>To support Soviet Union in eastern front and encircle \nGermany, the supreme headquarters decide to land \nEurope. We have been preparing this for a long time. \nCommander! This campaign could be the largest and \ntoughest you ever do.</string>
		<key>allies battle intro 8</key>
		<string>Germany is just ahead of us! I believe things will be \nmuch more brutal when we get in there. Every step \nforward requires us to pay a big price. The heavy \ncasualties that Soviet Union suffered in eastern front \nare a good example. Commander! Once you conquer \nGermany, we will get a big win over European theater. </string>
		<key>allies battle intro 9</key>
		<string>We are the most important force for allies in Far East. \nFor a long time we keep fighting against invaders and \nnever get conquered. Commander! It's time to take back \nthe territory we lost! Soviet Red Army will assist us in \nthe north east.</string>
		<key>allies battle intro 10</key>
		<string>Looking back in history you'll find no one, including \nGenghis Khan, has ever set foot on Japanese mainland \nfor a fight. But now a good opportunity comes to us. \nWe cannot miss it. Commander! You must figure out \nhow to eliminate their strong navy first.</string>
		
		<key>wto battle intro 1</key>
		<string>Seeing the emergence of socialist camp in Far East, \nAmerican-led NATO is totally provoked. They actually try \nto meddle in our reunification. We have to think about \nhow to resist them. Commander! This is never easy, \nbecause we're really left behind by their armament.</string>
		<key>wto battle intro 2</key>
		<string>The headquarters just receive the information that a \ngreat number of well-equipped Indian troops show up on \nthe western border. They even cross the boundary. \nCommander! It's an emergency. You must leave for the \nfront line right now!</string>
		<key>wto battle intro 3</key>
		<string>We must get a head start when both America and \nBritain have their eyes on oil resources in Middle East. \nCommander! If we lose our place here, we would have \nnothing to compete with them.</string>
		<key>wto battle intro 4</key>
		<string>To ease the pressure in other battleground, America and \nCanada form a joint fleet and start an attack in the \nPacific. You may want to know Marshal Nimitz takes the \nlead. Commander! Fighting in the sea is the last thing \nwe want! Our navy forces are way too weak.</string>
		<key>wto battle intro 5</key>
		<string>After getting military aid from America, Turkey launches \nassault on our ally Bulgaria. Commander! We need you \nto help Bulgaria destroy Turkey as well as Greece and \nYugoslavia. You must be quick! End up the war before \nthe arrival of America's reinforcement. Or we will be \nthrown into a passive position.</string>
		<key>wto battle intro 6</key>
		<string>Within weeks, NATO allies led by America and Britain \nhave seized Germany. They even cross the Germany-\nPoland border. At the same time, French and Italian \narmies are advancing to Hungary. Commander! The \nheadquarters command you to gather troops immediately \nand set out for the front line. Remember to start \ncounterattack when things are under control.</string>
		<key>wto battle intro 7</key>
		<string>After multiple successes against WTO, our sphere of \ninfluence has extended all over Europe, Asia and Africa. \nBut we will never stop! The headquarters are planning \nto assault South America and build a missile launch \nsite there, which could force America to make peace \nnegotiations. Commander! America can be very tricky to \ndeal with.</string>
		
		<key>nato battle intro 1</key>
		<string>As the Soviets carry guided missile launcher to Cuba, \nsthey could fire nuclear missile any minute. Commander! \nThe president orders you to destroy those devastating \nweapons by any means necessary. Also kick Soviets \nout of South America.</string>
		<key>nato battle intro 2</key>
		<string>It's not a secret that Soviet Union is scheming to \napproach West Europe, with Poland, Bulgaria, Romania \nand Hungary all its military allies. At present, they have \nfully controlled Germany after getting across Berlin Wall. \nThose who can compete with them in Europe are only \nBritain, France and Italy. Commander! This is the last \nline of defense. The future of Europe is in your hands.</string>
		<key>nato battle intro 3</key>
		<string>Now the Soviet Union and its allies have taken Africa. \nWe must send reinforcement as soon as possible, or \nthe enemy will soon target Mediterranean regions and \nthen Europe. Commander! General de Gaulle is going \nto join us in the war.</string>
		<key>nato battle intro 4</key>
		<string>The headquarters desire to liberate Middle East for next \nstep. As part of the plan, we would confuse the Soviets \nby breaking through Turkey while the truth is you \ndirectly go to the Middle East from where you are in \nAfrica. It's a long-prepared plan. Now it's time to turn \ninto action!</string>
		<key>nato battle intro 5</key>
		<string>It's a good idea to get into Asia by way of India. When \nwe're moving, however, India just turns its back on us. \nMeanwhile we find Soviet army shows up in India. \nCommander! The Soviets come to this through diplomacy, \nbut our only resort is fighting!</string>
		<key>nato battle intro 6</key>
		<string>It's good news that a rift occurs between the Soviet \nUnion and China. A border war even breaks out. \nCommander! Will you take this chance to cut off Soviet \nUnion's supply line in South Pacific? Australia is our \nonly ally there.</string>
		<key>nato battle intro 7</key>
		<string>Defeating the Soviet Union in its true sense means to \nmake them surrender at home. I know you can do this. \nAs the army is in position, headquarters command a \ngeneral offensive. Commander! Make progress very \ncarefully. The Soviets are well known for their strong \nmind!</string>

		<key>bank tip</key>
		<string>In each campaign you only have one chance to get a loan.</string>
			
		<key>tip 1</key>
		<string>With movement left, you can supply your forces one time after each round. You can also \nsupply strength supplies for injured forces in cities, industrial zone, airports and ports.</string>
		<key>tip 2</key>
		<string>After destroying enemies, your soldiers may have the chance to get more morale. If \nsurrounded by enemies, they may have mess morale.</string>
		<key>tip 3</key>
		<string>Armours, artilleries, rocket Launchers,tanks and heavy tanks all need to be recruited in \nindustrial zones while the navies in port. If you want to activate air forces, build an airport \nfirst.</string>
		<key>tip 4</key>
		<string>Armour army scares infantry most. Land fort is your first choice to defend navy attack.</string>
		<key>tip 5</key>
		<string>Entrenchment are cheap but good defensive work, however, they cannot stand up to tanks.</string>
		<key>tip 6</key>
		<string>For a large volume of enemies within an area, try to use air bombing. But it would be less \neffective if there are antiaircraft.</string>
		<key>tip 7</key>
		<string>Armours are the quickest military forces and your top choice to seize areas without \ndefense.</string>
		<key>tip 8</key>
		<string>Artilleries make enemies unable to fight back unless they have land forts.</string>
		<key>tip 9</key>
		<string>Carriers are the only option to get your army at sea. All carriers at sea have the same \nspeed.</string>
		<key>tip 10</key>
		<string>High-level cards need support from high-level technology. If you find some advanced cards \nunavailable, it's time to upgrade your technology with research card.</string>
		<key>tip 11</key>
		<string>Soldiers from different countries have different combat capability. America and Germany \nare strong in navy, army and air force. They also have commanders of high level.</string>

		<key>tutorails 1</key>
		<string>Hello, Commander! Let me show you how to do this.</string>
		<key>tutorails 2</key>
		<string>First of all, production and industry values are necessary \npillar for battle. Here is what we got.</string>
		<key>tutorails 3</key>
		<string>Basically, they come from output of our cities and industrial \nzones. Touch each area you will find these two values in \nthere.</string>
		<key>tutorails 4</key>
		<string>By touching the area where our forces locate you can move \nthem. Blue arrows point to movable areas while red arrows \npoint to battlegrounds.</string>
		<key>tutorails 5</key>
		<string>If you find any forces with the same base color as ours, \nthey are our allies. Please don't attack them.</string>
		<key>tutorails 6</key>
		<string>All forces have movement. When it comes down to 0, the \nforce  can't move.</string>
		<key>tutorails 7</key>
		<string>Each area allows four armies at most. We can adjust how \nthey distribute.</string>
		<key>tutorails 8</key>
		<string>Battleships can navigate at sea. Armies can also enter the \nsea as long as equipped with carriers.</string>
		<key>tutorails 9</key>
		<string>The left bottom button is tactical card, through which you \ncan carry out tactical operation.</string>
		<key>tutorails 10</key>
		<string>They are classified into forces, development, and strategy. \nEach has unique function. Using any of these cards would \ncost you production and industry values.</string>
		<key>tutorails 11</key>
		<string>Only the city or industrial zone of high level could recruit \narmy while port is the only place to recruit navy.</string>
		<key>tutorails 12</key>
		<string>If your technology level is lower than request, you are \nunable to use the card until you upgrade the technology.</string>
		<key>tutorails 13</key>
		<string>Some special cards need time to cool down before you \nuse them again. </string>
		<key>tutorails 14</key>
		<string>Command card is only applicable for one military unit.</string>
		<key>tutorails 15</key>
		<string>Build airports to launch air strikes or bomb hostile \nterritories, but air forces have limited combat areas.</string>
		<key>tutorails 16</key>
		<string>Through the System button on top right corner, you can \nsave the game, look up options, restart or quit.</string>
		<key>tutorails 17</key>
		<string>After all deployment, you can touch the wait button in right \nbottom corner to wait for next round.</string>
		<key>tutorails 18</key>
		<string>Commander! You would fail if all of your land territory are \nlost. Please take note of it.</string>

		<string>Commander! No matter how incredible you were, this time \nyou throw our country into a totally passive position. The \nheadquarters cannot accept your explanation. You will be \ndischarged all commanding powers you have.</string>

		<string>Commander! You failed to accomplish the goal on time, \nthat's why we lost the war. The headquarters just send a \nnotice that all commanding powers you have are discharged.</string>

		<string>Commander! The dogged enemies are so offensive that you \nalmost lose your confidence, but you finally win.  You will \nbe rewarded with 5 extra medals.</string>
		<key>commander victory 5</key>
		<string>Commander! You didn't win until the last moment, so it \nmakes sense that the headquarters won't give you anything \nfor reward.</string>

		<key>axis battle 1 Guderian 1</key>
		<string>In order to make sudden strike, my armour forces will move \nto Warsaw without resting.</string>
		<key>axis battle 1 Guderian 2</key>
		<string>If you want to attack Warsaw with me, you must take \nother cities and regions first and quickly.</string>
		<key>axis battle 1 Guderian 3</key>
		<string>Commander! Try to win the war as soon as possible. The \nfuehrer doesn't give us too much time.</string>
		<key>axis battle 1 Guderian 4</key>
		<string>My armour forces have broken through the outer defense \nline. Now Warsaw is so close to us.</string>
		<key>axis battle 1 Guderian 5</key>
		<string>If we fight together, the victory can come earlier!</string>
		
		<key>axis battle 2 Guderian 1</key>
		<string>Commander! This time you lead army group B to attack \nDenmark and Norway in North Europe.</string>
		<key>axis battle 2 Guderian 2</key>
		<string>It's not the first time we work together. You must know my \ntactics well.</string>
		<key>axis battle 2 Guderian 3</key>
		<string>I'm coming near to Paris very soon. Hope to see your army \nright then.</string>
		<key>axis battle 2 Guderian 4</key>
		<string>My armour forces are going forward at amazing speed. We \neven have no time to take prisoners.</string>
		<key>axis battle 2 de Gaulle 1</key>
		<string>It's a life or death moment. Soldiers! Use your weapons to \nkill enemies before they kill you.</string>
		
		<key>axis battle 3 Rommel 1</key>
		<string>Commander! My armour forces are mopping up French \nforces in the south.</string>
		<key>axis battle 3 Rommel 2</key>
		<string>Take care of the British army across the British Channel. \nMarshal Goering will support you with air forces.</string>
		<key>axis battle 3 Goering 1</key>
		<string>My air forces are in position. I don't think the British have \nmuch air superiority now.</string>
		
		<key>axis battle 4 Graziani 1</key>
		<string>Commander! My battleships will stand by you. It's a piece \nof cake to win the battle.</string>
		<key>axis battle 4 Graziani 2</key>
		<string>I didn't realize their costal artillery is so accurate. My \nbattleships suffer heavy damage.</string>
		<key>axis battle 4 Guider 1</key>
		<string>Commander! You must completely destroy the hostile fleets \nfor final success of the campaign.</string>
		
		<key>axis battle 5 Rommel 1</key>
		<string>Italian army is not as good as we thought. So the fuehrer \nsends us to help them in North Africa.</string>
		<key>axis battle 5 Rommel 2</key>
		<string>The enemies are a few times more than us, but not \ncombat power! We only need to focus on Britain and \nFrance.</string>
		<key>axis battle 5 Rommel 3</key>
		<string>German armour forces are powerful. When they come to us, \nholding our ground is winning!</string>
		<key>axis battle 5 Montgomery 1</key>
		<string>There's no way to stop my tiger tank.</string>
		
		<key>axis battle 6 Guderian 1</key>
		<string>Commander! My army is heading for Kiev.</string>
		<key>axis battle 6 Guderian 2</key>
		<string>Your task is to occupy Minsk, and then we meet in \nMoscow.</string>
		<key>axis battle 6 Guderian 3</key>
		<string>Finland and Hungary will help us, but don't count too much \non them.</string>
		<key>axis battle 6 Rokossovsky 1</key>
		<string>Soldiers! Stand your ground! Defend your country!</string>
		<key>axis battle 6 Zhukov 1</key>
		<string>The fighting is pointless if our capital falls.</string>
		
		<key>axis battle 7 Yamamoto 1</key>
		<string>Commander! Assaulting American fleet can be very risky.</string>
		<key>axis battle 7 Yamamoto 2</key>
		<string>Once drawn the katana cannot be sheathed until it kills. \nFight with all your might.</string>
		<key>axis battle 7 Nimitz 1</key>
		<string>Soldiers! Get back to your position. We're attacked! It's not \nexercise.</string>
		
		<key>axis battle 8 Guider 1</key>
		<string>Commander! You must seize these areas quickly, because \nthe emperor needs resources.</string>
		<key>axis battle 8 Guider 2</key>
		<string>The thing is Britain has sent a strong fleet ahead to block \nour progress. </string>
		<key>axis battle 8 Guider 3</key>
		<string>I suggest using air forces to hit their fleet.</string>
		
		<key>axis battle 9 Yamamoto 1</key>
		<string>Commander! China and Britain are massing forces in Burma. \nThey are going to fire back.</string>
		<key>axis battle 9 Yamamoto 2</key>
		<string>We suffered heavy loss in the Pacific war. We cannot help \nyou anymore.</string>
		<key>axis battle 9 Zhang 1</key>
		<string>Soldiers! Take back our land!</string>
		
		<key>axis battle 10 Goering 1</key>
		<string>Actually American has got the hang of nuclear technology. \nThat's why the fuehrer hurries to start the war before we \nare ready.</string>
		<key>axis battle 10 Goering 2</key>
		<string>We convince Italy and Japan to fight North America with us, \nso we can relieve some stress.</string>
		<key>axis battle 10 Goering 3</key>
		<string>Commander! The fuehrer and all fellowmen are hoping to \nsee you back in triumph.</string>
		<key>axis battle 10 Patton 1</key>
		<string>Soldiers! Use our tank to crush enemies down!</string>
		<key>axis battle 10 MacArthur 1</key>
		<string>Be brave! Man! Only the daredevil can survive.</string>
		
		<key>allies battle 1 Zhukov 1</key>
		<string>Commander! Our country is facing the most dangerous \nmoment!</string>
		<key>allies battle 1 Zhukov 2</key>
		<string>We take charge of different places, but it's obvious your \ndefense is the most important.</string>
		<key>allies battle 1 Zhukov 3</key>
		<string>Soviet Union is very large, but we can find no way out \nexcept Moscow in the back.</string>
		<key>allies battle 1 Rokossovsky 1</key>
		<string>I have executed some deserters myself. Don't doubt my \nloyalty.</string>
		
		<key>allies battle 2 Nimitz 1</key>
		<string>After air strikes on Tokyo, Japan is targeting the Midway \nIsland for revenge.</string>
		<key>allies battle 2 Nimitz 2</key>
		<string>Midway Island is an important naval harbor in Pacific Ocean. \nConsidering its strategic value, we have to hold it by any \nmeans.</string>
		<key>allies battle 2 Nimitz 3</key>
		<string>Commander! My fleet will support you with all strength.</string>
		<key>allies battle 2 Yamamoto 1</key>
		<string>This time almost all navy in the emperor turn out.</string>
		<key>allies battle 2 Yamamoto 2</key>
		<string>This sea battle decides the country's destiny.</string>
		
		<key>allies battle 3 Montgomery 1</key>
		<string>Germany and Italy are moving again. Their commander \nGeneral Rommel is very talented.</string>
		<key>allies battle 3 Montgomery 2</key>
		<string>He is like a fox in the desert. We have to watch out his \narmour forces.</string>
		<key>allies battle 3 Rommel 1</key>
		<string>Assaulting in the desert is undesirable for my armour forces. </string>
		
		<key>allies battle 4 Zhukov 1</key>
		<string>The battle plan is revised again and again before the \nheadquarters make a final call.</string>
		<key>allies battle 4 Zhukov 2</key>
		<string>This is such a massive war that we put almost all forces \nwe have in it.</string>
		<key>allies battle 4 Rokossovsky 1</key>
		<string>This campaign is unprecedented yet crucial. You can't be \ntoo careful about it.</string>
		<key>allies battle 4 Guderian 1</key>
		<string>My tank forces cut into the enemy's heartland like a knife.</string>
		<key>allies battle 4 Goering 1</key>
		<string>My ace forces already freak the enemy out.</string>
		
		<key>allies battle 5 Patton 1</key>
		<string>Commander! We must overcome the Italians quickly, \nbecause the Germans are on the way.</string>
		<key>allies battle 5 Patton 2</key>
		<string>We don't have too much time left.</string>
		<key>allies battle 5 Rommel 1</key>
		<string>According to the fuehrer, we will take over Italy's army and \ndefense system.</string>
		
		<key>allies battle 6 Guider 1</key>
		<string>From intelligence we know Japan's elite troops are \nassembling in Burma. I believe they will march to India \nsoon.</string>
		<key>allies battle 6 Zhang 1</key>
		<string>Commander! The Chinese forces will assist you from the \nside to beat Japan. We share the same goal.</string>
		<key>allies battle 6 Yamamoto 1</key>
		<string>We get serious supply problems. Disease also starts to \nspread.</string>
		<key>allies battle 6 Yamamoto 2</key>
		<string>But for the Mikado we have nothing to fear.</string>
		
		<key>allies battle 7 Nimitz 1</key>
		<string>We made a lot of preparation earlier, but such a massive \nlanding operation is totally new.</string>
		<key>allies battle 7 Patton 1</key>
		<string>This time German troops are led by Rommel for defense. I \ncan't wait to challenge him.</string>
		<key>allies battle 7 de Gaulle 1</key>
		<string>Finally we are home! To liberate France, move on!</string>
		<key>allies battle 7 Nimitz 2</key>
		<string>Our soldiers have some difficulty when landing. My fleet will \nspare no efforts to cover them.</string>
		<key>allies battle 7 Rommel 1</key>
		<string>If my defense line is breached, my armour forces will come \nto help immediately.</string>
		
		<key>allies battle 8 MacArthur 1</key>
		<string>Germany refuses to surrender. Their main forces are \nconcentrated within the country.</string>
		<key>allies battle 8 MacArthur 2</key>
		<string>Soviet Union is moving forward Warsaw in east front. Poland \nwill get free sooner or later.</string>
		<key>allies battle 8 Patton 1</key>
		<string>Commander! My tanks will charge forward. Follow me. \nVictory belongs to us.</string>
		<key>allies battle 8 Goering 1</key>
		<string>Nothing can break the great Third Reich down.</string>
		<key>allies battle 8 Rommel 1</key>
		<string>Our soldiers are good, but there are way too many \nenemies!</string>
		
		<key>allies battle 9 Zhang 1</key>
		<string>Now two of the axis powers, Germany and Italy, have put \nup the white flag. The situation is in our favor.</string>
		<key>allies battle 9 Zhang 2</key>
		<string>The headquarters decide to launch a large campaign on \nJapan. We are going to make up the lost ground.</string>
		<key>allies battle 9 Zhang 3</key>
		<string>This morning Soviet Union just declared war against Japan \nwho currently takes up the northeast China. So Japan has \nto deal with two battles. </string>
		
		<key>allies battle 10 MacArthur 1</key>
		<string>Japan is ready for a defensive war. They claim they will \nfight to the last man.</string>
		<key>allies battle 10 MacArthur 2</key>
		<string>I can imagine how crazy the Japanese would be. The \nsamurai moral is no kidding!</string>
		<key>allies battle 10 MacArthur 3</key>
		<string>Commander! Don't feel any mercy for them. You can use \nour new weapon - atomic bomb if necessary.</string>
		<key>allies battle 10 Nimitz 1</key>
		<string>No one but us can compete with Japanese navy. Allies \nneed us to protect their carriers.</string>
		<key>allies battle 10 Yamamoto 1</key>
		<string>Soldiers! For Mikado, let's fight to the last minute!</string>
		
		<key>wto battle 1 Peng 1</key>
		<string>The reunification is almost coming true. But at this time \nAmerican fleet shows up along the coast.</string>
		<key>wto battle 1 Peng 2</key>
		<string>Commander! America has far more advanced weapons than \nus. You need to adjust your strategy.</string>
		<key>wto battle 1 Peng 3</key>
		<string>I can't give you any help now, because the headquarters \nsend my army to aid Korea.</string>
		<key>wto battle 1 MacArthur 1</key>
		<string>We should finish the war before Christmas. Then soldiers \ncan spend the holiday with their families. </string>
		
		<key>wto battle 2 Guider 1</key>
		<string>Indian troops are deep into Tibetan areas. They are not \nalone. Britain is behind them.</string>
		<key>wto battle 2 Guider 2</key>
		<string>The headquarters have approved your battle plan. First divide \nand encircle the enemy, then wipe them out. </string>
		<key>wto battle 2 Guider 3</key>
		<string>General Peng is coming to assist you as fast as possible.</string>
		<key>wto battle 2 Peng 1</key>
		<string>Obviously India underestimated us. They thought they could \nwin with America's weapons.</string>
		
		<key>wto battle 3 Zhukov 1</key>
		<string>Oil in Arab areas is the ultimate key to success.</string>
		<key>wto battle 3 Zhukov 2</key>
		<string>We must move quickly. Take up the area before American \narmy arrives.</string>
		
		<key>wto battle 4 Rokossovsky 1</key>
		<string>It's impossible to beat their fleet.</string>
		<key>wto battle 4 Rokossovsky 2</key>
		<string>What we can do is building more costal artillery and waiting \nfor them.</string>
		<key>wto battle 4 Rokossovsky 3</key>
		<string>We must stop them landing. Otherwise, we will face terrible \nsituation.</string>
		
		<key>wto battle 5 Guider 1</key>
		<string>Commander! Bulgaria is at stake now!</string>
		<key>wto battle 5 Guider 2</key>
		<string>The headquarters realize you must set off to save them.</string>
		<key>wto battle 6 Rokossovsky 1</key>
		<string>Commander! Our union faces the most severe test ever. \nThe enemy is mounting an all-out attack.</string>
		<key>wto battle 6 Rokossovsky 2</key>
		<string>The headquarters want us to strike back from different \ndirections.</string>
		
		<key>wto battle 7 Guider 1</key>
		<string>American intelligence already discovers our plan to invade \nSouth America.</string>
		<key>wto battle 7 Guider 2</key>
		<string>They begin to deploy troops in South America. Commander! \nHurry up! Blow them out of water!</string>
		<key>wto battle 7 Guider 3</key>
		<string>We must take the missile launcher to designated location. \nThis is of great importance to our success.</string>
		
		<key>nato battle 1 Patton 1</key>
		<string>Commander! The Soviet Union has built a nuclear site in \nCuba.</string>
		<key>nato battle 1 Patton 2</key>
		<string>So far their nuclear bomb can destroy the whole North \nAmerica. We can't keep silent anymore.</string>
		<key>nato battle 1 Patton 3</key>
		<string>Our goal is to kick them out of South America and remove \nnuclear threat.</string>
		<key>nato battle 1 Patton 4</key>
		<string>We have to speed up. They could trigger the nuclear bomb \nany minute.</string>
		
		<key>nato battle 2 Montgomery 1</key>
		<string>The Red Army starts to expand its power in Europe.</string>
		<key>nato battle 2 Montgomery 2</key>
		<string>Commander! I hope you can use the fortification to hang on \na few more days.</string>
		<key>nato battle 2 Montgomery 3</key>
		<string>My army would head to European mainland as fast as we \ncan.</string>

		<string>The whole Europe will become red very soon. The First \nSecretary is looking forward to it.</string>
		
		<key>nato battle 3 de Gaulle 1</key>
		<string>I'm fighting against Poland. I'm worried Hungary nearby may \nattack me from behind.</string>
		<key>nato battle 3 de Gaulle 2</key>
		<string>Of course, the Soviet Union in back of them is the real \nenemy.</string>
		<key>nato battle 3 Patton 1</key>
		<string>Commander! The headquarters transfer me from Europe to \nhelp you out in Africa.</string>
		<key>nato battle 3 Patton 2</key>
		<string>It costs them a lot of work to convey my tanks from \nAmerica.</string>
		<key>nato battle 3 Patton 3</key>
		<string>I believe my tanks are extremely useful to you.</string>
		
		<key>nato battle 4 Nimitz 1</key>
		<string>At present those Arab oil fields are controlled by the \nSoviets. We want them back.</string>
		<key>nato battle 4 Nimitz 2</key>
		<string>Just as planned, their main forces are distracted when I \napproach Turkey.</string>
		<key>nato battle 4 Nimitz 3</key>
		<string>You must seize the moment to get through the channel. \nMy fleet there will cover you.</string>

		<string>Obviously India has swung to the Soviet Union, which \nmeans we have a lot of difficulties to land Asia.</string>
		<key>nato battle 5 MacArthur 2</key>
